          Many people struggle when it comes to maintaining and establishing
          habits. Although it takes around 18 days for a task to become a habit,
          people struggle and find it challenging to stay consistent with
          healthy habits such as hydration, exercise, and sleep, even if they
          have the strongest desire or will-power to improve their lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p>
          As awareness grows about the importance of habits for achieving long
          term health and personal goals, individuals have difficulty finding
          motivation or self discipline. They tend to get overwhelmed when
          dealing with the complications of adding a new habit to their day to
          day lives, potentially leading to burnout. Stress also impedes habit
          formation as people who are under pressure can get distracted, and off
          track. Without any reminders or tracked progress, people may feel
          disconnected from their goals and lose their motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obstacles, such as fear of failure, fear of change, or negative
          mindsets could prevent new habits from sticking in the long run.
          Understanding these obstacles and how valuable it is to form new
          habits can help in the creation of successful strategies when
          introducing them into one's lifestyle.

          Creating the Habitz application will give users a way to track
          progress and eliminate setbacks when integrating new habits into their
          everyday lives. Some ways this application will improve one's ability
          to maintain habits is by having progress tabs, activities, and a mood
          tracker/journal to allow users to customize and ensure they are
          staying up to date with their habit integration.
